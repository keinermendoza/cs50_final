            <p>Have you ever wondered what those strange dishes that appear on your phone in the emoji food section are?
                surely you will have noticed that applications like WhatsApp or pages like Facebook allow you to use
                small images to express emotions <span>😁</span>, activities <span>🏃‍♂️</span> and even food <span>🍔</span>, these "figurines" are called Emojis or Emoticons.
                However, the meals usually represent different cultures, so it is normal not to know the
                dishes from cultures very different from their own.
            </p>
            <p>This page is created so that you can see through photos and explanations (taken from Wikipedia) what each of these are
                129 Emojis related to food. Here you can give <span class="key-word">&#128077</span> to those emojis that you like the most, and see which are the preferred emojis of the other users of this page.
            </p>
            <p>Most likely you know most of the dishes that you will see represented with emojis but there will certainly be others that you don't
                you will have the slightest idea. Without further ado, I hope you enjoy your time here and that it is very useful to you, as tasty as it is.
                See the photos, I just have to wish you bon appetit! 😉
